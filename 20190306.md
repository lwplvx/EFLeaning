I have learned a little bit of French, Spanish, German, Italian, Chinese, and some Russian.

I have over 13,000 hours experience, teaching over 13,000 students from more than 65 countries all over the world (1/3 of the world), and I have developed this natural method to learning.



This is the natural way we learn a first language, and is also effective in learning other languages.

Writing - Write in a notebook words and phrases by topic or category in your language, and then translate to English, also writing down the synonyms (like, love, enjoy, adore) and antonyms (like / dislike, love / hate, in / out, up / down), and other definitions and forms of words (write, writing, wrote, written). Write questions and responses, in past, present, and future tense using the new vocabulary. Read the questions and responses speaking the words. Review.

***THIS IS NOT THE ADVICE OF EDUCATION FIRST.***

***THIS IS MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.***

You still need to keep you private lessons with a native English speaking teacher, so you can listen to the different accents and ask them: 'Is this how I correctly say this word?' And, 'Is this how I correctly use this word in a sentence?'

The teachers are here to help you learn, but you should be doing more outside of class than inside of class.



You can book a class with me through the EF system or by contacting me at: Carl.K@teachers.org

***这不是教育的建议。***

***这是我的个人和专业建议。***

你仍然需要和母语为英语的老师一起学习私人课程，这样你就可以听到不同的口音并问他们：'这是我正确说出这个词吗？'并且，'这是我在句子中正确使用这个词的方式吗？'

老师们在这里帮助你学习，但你应该在课外做更多的事情，而不是课堂内。
